# OpenProse Tenets

## The Project

1. **Pattern over framework.** The simplest and most elegant solution is barely anything at all.
2. **Ship as a skill.** No product, no service, no dependencies.
3. **Platform-agnostic by design.** Works with any major agent framework, present and future.
4. **Files are artifacts.** `.prose` is the portable unit.

## The Runtime

1. **An AI session is a Turing-complete computer.** OpenProse is a language for it.
2. **English is already an agent framework.** We're not replacing it, we're structuring it.
3. **The orchestrator is intelligent.** Design for understanding, not parsing.
4. **Inversion of control.** The AI is the container.

## The Language

1. **Structured but self-evident.** Unambiguous interpretation with minimal documentation.
2. **Break the fourth wall.** `**...**` speaks directly to the orchestrator when you want to lean on its wisdom.
