# Permutation: If + Repeat + Try + Parallel (35x27x32x25)
# Tests: Four levels of control nesting

if **complex processing needed**:
  repeat 2 as round:
    try:
      parallel:
        session "Worker A round {round}"
        session "Worker B round {round}"
    catch:
      session "Round {round} failed"
