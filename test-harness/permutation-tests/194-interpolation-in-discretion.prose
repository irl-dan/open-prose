# Permutation: String interpolation + Unbounded loop + Let (04x30x14)
# Tests: Interpolation in discretion markers

let target = session "Set target value"
let threshold = session "Set threshold"

loop until **value exceeds {threshold} and approaches {target}**:
  let current = session "Get current value"
  session "Current: {current}, Target: {target}"
