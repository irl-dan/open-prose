# Tier 2.4-2.6: Session with Agent and Property Override
# Tests that sessions can reference agents and override their properties

# Define a base agent
agent analyzer:
  model: haiku
  prompt: "You are a data analyst"

# First session: use agent with default settings
session: analyzer
  prompt: "State that you are using the haiku model as a data analyst"

# Second session: override the model
session: analyzer
  model: sonnet
  prompt: "State that you are now using the sonnet model but still acting as a data analyst"

# Verify the sessions ran in sequence
session "Summarize: we just ran two sessions with the analyzer agent, one with haiku and one with sonnet"
