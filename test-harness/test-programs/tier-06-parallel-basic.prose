# Tier 6.1: Basic Parallel Blocks
# Tests parallel: block for concurrent execution

# Basic parallel block - run all branches concurrently
parallel:
  session "Generate three random colors"
  session "Generate three random numbers between 1 and 100"
  session "Generate three random animal names"

# Session after parallel waits for all branches to complete
session "Summarize all the random items that were generated above"
