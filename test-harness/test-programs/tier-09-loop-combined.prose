# Tier 9.5: Loop Combined with Other Features
# Tests unbounded loop combined with parallel blocks and context

# Gather initial opinions from multiple perspectives
parallel:
  optimist = session "As an optimist, what's one positive trend you see in AI development?"
  pessimist = session "As a skeptic, what's one concern you have about AI development?"

# Iterate to find common ground
loop until **both perspectives have found a balanced middle ground** (max: 3):
  session "Review both perspectives and identify where they agree and disagree"
    context: { optimist, pessimist }
  session "Propose a synthesis that acknowledges both views"

# Final summary
session "Write a balanced one-paragraph summary that incorporates both optimistic and cautionary perspectives on AI."
