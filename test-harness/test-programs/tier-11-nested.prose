# Tests: inner catch handles inner errors, outer catch for outer errors

try:
  session "Begin outer operation"
  try:
    session "Perform inner risky operation"
  catch:
    session "Handle inner error gracefully"
  session "Continue outer operation after inner try"
catch:
  session "Handle outer error (only if inner rethrows)"

session "Program continues after all error handling"
